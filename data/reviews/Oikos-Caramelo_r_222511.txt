Oikos Greek yogurt is my favorite brand of Greek and I have tried them all! I purchase the 0% fat plain and it has played a huge role in my weight loss journey. 0% Fat Plain Oikos Greek Yogurt is a "free" food and I mix it with different fruits - I eat 1 cup of yogurt at least twice a day.It is thick and creamy with no aftertaste. BTW - I have lost 90 lbs :)
