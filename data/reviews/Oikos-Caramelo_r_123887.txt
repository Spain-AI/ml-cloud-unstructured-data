This is my go to every day yogurt. I Have it every morning for breakfast. Every flavour is so delicious. Itâ€™s a nice thick and creamy texture. It needs to come in bigger sizes, never enough to satisfy the craving yet it the perfect size to keep you wanting more. Little pricey to buy full price but I always look for a sale like 3 for $10.
