I'm so glad they made the triple zero yogurt. I have diabetes and I love yogurt but most are loaded with sugar that offer a variety of flavors. My favorites are salted and coconut. I mix a little granola in them to help balance me out, but they are good without it. Thet have a thick consistency but whip it up and its smooth. I wish they would offer these flavors in there larger containers. That is my only complaint.
